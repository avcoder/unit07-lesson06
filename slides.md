# What is CI/CD?
Aims to improve speed, efficiency, and reliability of software delivery

-  merge your code changes into the shared repository without breaking anything
- Continuous Integration:
  - Changes are committed regularly; Unit tests are run
  - Goal: identify problems early
- Continuous Delivery:
  - Automated build processes to prepare for release after testing
  - Goal: always have a version of software that can be deployed
- Continuous Deployment:
  - Fully automated deployment to prod environments

# CI/CD Phases

- Build phase: upon pushing code, that event triggers an automatic `npm run build` where code is compiled into a single executable (see Netlify's terminal during build)
- Test phase: The build is tested to ensure no errors in Unit Tests, Linting, Typescript, etc.
- Staging: The app is run in a production-like environment (ex: a temporary url) that devs can test to ensure it's ready for prod
- Deployment: App is automatically deployed to end-users

# Github Actions

- **Events** is when something happens (new push, PR, new issue etc) that triggers to run a workflow
- **Runners** are servers that runs your tasks 
- **Jobs** is a collection of steps (simple commands, scripts, actions) executed on the same runner and are defined in a workflow.  
- **Workflows** is a series of jobs triggered upon an event; coded in yaml; stored .github/workflows/ in your repo
- **Github Actions** consist of events, jobs, tasks, runners, workflows.

# Starter Workflow

- `on:` - defines triggers on certain branches to run workflow (like JS add event listeners) 
- `permissions:` - made available to Actions/Commands that provide GH token to access GH API
- `jobs:` - sets up job and runner to process work flow and steps to run it

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read    # Allows checkout and read-only access to the repo content
  pull-requests: read  # Required if your workflow interacts with PR metadata (e.g., checks)

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

```

# Steps
Most of work takes place in Steps

```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # 1st step: checks out the code from branch

    - name: Use Node.js 
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # 2nd step: sets up a project environment
      with:
        node-version: 22
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install dependencies # 3rd step: installs dependencies
      run: npm i

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test # 4th step: runs tests, or linter, etc.

    - name: Deploy
      run: echo "Deploy step goes here"
```

# YAML

- A Dash `-` is used to define an array.  
  ```yaml
  colors:
    - red # Use 2 spaces (not tabs) for one indent
    - green
    - blue 
  # JS analogy: `{ "colors": ["red", "green", "blue"] }`
  ```
  ```yaml
  steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
  # JS analogy: const steps = [
  #   { name: "Checkout code", uses: "actions/checkout@v4" },
  #   { name: "Install dependencies", run: "npm install" }
  # ];
  ```
- Don't use dashes when defining a single object, key-value pairs that aren't inside an array:

# Exercise: How to Build a Simple CI/CD Pipeline

- Go to a Github repo and click `Settings` tab at top right corner
- Left hand menu, click Pages
- Under Build and Deployment > under Branch > change dropdown to "main" > click Save
- Left hand menu, under Actions > click General > scroll down to Workflow permissions > click Read and Write permissions > click Save
- Open code, and in root folder create `./github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
  ```yml
  name: Deploy React frontend to GitHub Pages

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Other options: ubuntu-22.04, windows-latest, windows-2022, macos-latest etc.        
  ```
