# What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment

- Continuous Integration:
  - Changes are committed regularly
  - Unit tests are run
  - Goal: identify problems early
- Continuous Delivery:
  - Automated build processes
  - Software is ready for release
  - Goal: always have a version of software that can be deployed
- Continuous Deployment:
  - Fully automated deployment to prod environments
  - rapid reliable development cycles

# Github Actions
an automation framework for software workflows

- Workflows are coded in yaml and stored .github/workflows/ in your repo
- Events are the triggers (new push, PR, new issue etc) that run a workflow
- Runners are compute layers (ex: ubuntu, windows, macos) and come with preinstalled tools, compilers.
- Each workflows has one or more jobs.  Jobs are high-level tasks that uses steps (simple commands, scripts, actions)
- Actions are useful for running common tasks in repeatable fashion
- Depending on the kind of files you have in your repo, Github can suggest which starter workflow works best to build, package and deploy your code

# Starter Workflow

- `on:` - defines triggers on certain branches to run workflow (like JS add event listeners) 
- `permissions:` - made available to Actions/Commands that provide GH token to access GH API
- `jobs:` - sets up job and runner to process work flow and steps to run it

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

```

# Steps
Most of work takes place in Steps

```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # 1st step: checks out the code from branch

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # 2nd step: sets up a project environment
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install dependencies # 3rd step: installs dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test # 4th step: runs tests, or linter, etc.
```
